Recruiter Service â€“ Placement Portal
In our Placement Portal Project, I implemented various functionalities related to recruiter operations. This includes job postings, recruiter profile management, a dashboard, and other key features to enhance the recruiter experience.

ðŸ”¹ Job Posting
Implemented a @PostMapping method called insertjob, allowing recruiters to add job postings.
This method calls recruiterService.addingjob() to save job details in the database.
After saving, it redirects to the rview_job_postings page with a confirmation message.

ðŸ”¹ Recruiter Profile Management
Added new fields in the Recruiter entity, including:
About Me
Education & Certifications
Skills & Expertise
Linked Accounts
Updated the RecruiterService to handle profile updates and modifications.

ðŸ”¹ Recruiter Dashboard Features
Developed a recruiter dashboard with essential sections like:
Job Postings
Candidates
Interviews
Settings
Designed a sidebar and multiple info cards to display key recruiter metrics efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Viewing Student Applications
Created a dedicated page for recruiters to view student applications.
Ensured consistent UI/UX by maintaining the same CSS and layout as other pages.

ðŸ”¹ Settings & Profile
Integrated a Profile section within the Settings page of the recruiter dashboard.
This allows recruiters to manage their personal details and professional information.


ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
Looking forward to adding more features like:
Resume Parsing to extract key details from uploaded resumes.
AI-based Candidate Matching to suggest the best applicants for a job.
Interview Scheduling System with calendar integration.
